# Charity-Water-game-Ripple-Effect

Ripple Effect is an interactive browser game inspired by charity: water’s mission to bring clean water to communities in need. Players tap falling water droplets to collect clean water while avoiding polluted drops. Each click creates a ripple of change — boosting scores, triggering streak bonuses, and spreading awareness. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the game demonstrates responsive design, interactivity, and branded visual storytelling. Celebrate wins, track your impact, and make every drop count.
